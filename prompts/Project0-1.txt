Create a console application that will function as a mock bank using solely Java 1.8. Persist your data in a text file (username, password, account balance, etc.). 
					write functionality to serialize your bank after every transaction? optional

As a user, I can:
	* create an account with a unique email or username, along with a password (for this first iteration, multiple users need not be accommodated) 
	* log in 
	* log out
	* deposit money
	* withdraw money
	* view balance

To note: There are no strict requirements regarding the flow of operation for your program, but keep the user in mind. Is your menu clear? Is user input validated? Do I have to log back in after each transaction? All important things to consider.
