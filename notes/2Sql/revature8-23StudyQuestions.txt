what's a view?

What does PL SQL?
		procedural language, structured query language. used for oracle
Can you use a stored procedure in a select statement?
		no

Similar and difference of function vs Stored Procedure?
		stored procedure more flexible than function, but function you're allowed to use other functions and use inside select statements. like can do SELECT AVG(), but cant make a procedure called DIRT and do SELECT DIRT()

		Stored Procedure you can return multiple parameters and edit
		data using DML/TCL.

		Function can use other system defined functions, select.
		SP can take input or output or both params, Function only input

		Both take 0 to many parameters
