transaction phenomena
		problems that come up cuz of concurrent transactions
	1. dirty road - a transaction which reads uncommitted data
		eg. transaction a: adds 'ben franklin', 
			transaction b: queries for everyone last name franklin
						   26 ben franklin
						   10 sally franklin
			rollsback -    ben franklin is no longer valid data
						   as it was in transaction b.
			*transaction b was the one reading uncommitted data
	2. nonrepeatable read - data in one transaction has changed in 
		the duration or the transaction by another transaction
		eg  transaction a: queries for first name sally
							10 sally franklin
							28 sally jones
			transaction b: updates last name to "smith" where id = 10.
			transaction a: queries for first name sally
							10 sally smith
							28 sally jones
	3. Phantom read - if datas inserted or deleted during the 
		duration of first transaction by another transaction
		eg  transaction a: queries for classname "McCormick"
							Paul    McCormick
			transaction b: inserts in 59: "Lisa", "McCormick"
			transaction a: queries for classname "McCormick"
							Paul McCormick		
							Lisa McCormick  <=== Phantom data lol
			*note: transaction b happens during transaction a. and
					though it says transaction a twice, it just means
					transaction a keeps going, goes to next step


						Isolation Levels
	*X means option prevents these
				  Dirty Read   Nonrepeatable Read   Phantom Read
Read Uncommitted 
Read Committed(default) X
Repeatable Read         X				X
Serializable            X				X					 X
