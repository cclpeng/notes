	virtual table we can create off a sql query

Index
	an in memory ordering set on a particular column
	makes data retrieval more efficient
	makes insertion/deletion less efficient
	good in read-only situations

Functions
	scalar v aggregate
	concat   count/sum

	Can be used in select statements
	only returns one thing

	user defined functions are available
		However, in defined function, we can only select, no DML.
		only dql. 
		Can make 0 to many arguments

		eg. Syntax of creation:
			CREATE FUNCTION FUNC([PROGRAMS])      or
			CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION FUNC([PROGRAMS])
			RETURN [DATA TYPE]
			IS
				--declare any extra variables
			BEGIN
				--executable code (which could use other funcs but not stored procedures)
			END;
			/ 		--make it end
	Stored Procedures (Different from functions!!)
		Saved block of pl/sql
		Can't be used in select statements
		can return 0 to many parameters
		can take 0 to many parametrs INPUT, OUTPUT, OR BOTH PARAMETERS
		Full use of DML and TCL

		eg. how to create
		CREATE PROCEDURE [NAME] [PARAMS]       or
		CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE __ __
		--if you put output parameters in PARAMS, then don't need to specify rturn type..output parameter is rtn type
		IS
		BEGIN
		END;
		/    --let sql know were done w user defined
			eg. 
				let's say our stored procedure does x^y = z
				specify as variables: x in type, y in type, z out type
				my_procedure(x,y,z);
				now z will carry our returned value
