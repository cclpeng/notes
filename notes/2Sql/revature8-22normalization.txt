Normalization
	organizing our database in order to reduce redundancy and prevent 
	data anomalies. Organizing can mean spreading the information
	of one table into multiple tables
		why reduce redundancy?
			help save space

WHen not normalize something? Denormalization
	if we're using the same joins all the time across the newly created tables, maybe better to just have the redundant data
	many normal forms, a db is considered to be sufficiently 
		normalized after 3
	benefits of norm/denormalization
		
		First Normal Form: Each record needs a unique identifier 
							(primary key)
							no duplicate rows
							atomic values
//FIXME atomic values heheh :) Everything in the column has to be
								a single value. No lists of values

		Second Normal Form: first normal + eliminate partial 
							dependencies
							a column which is dependent on part of a 
								composite key
									composite keys primary key
									made of more than 1 column
		if no composite keys tho,
		Third Normal Form: Meet 2nd normal, No Transitive Dependencies
			a column which derives its value from another column


	eg.
				Invoice 105
							8/21/18
							Dan
				Item 	   quantity 	price		total
				toothbrush    2			2		    4
				pillow		  5 		12			60
				toothpaste    1 		6 			6
				candle 		  3 		10 			30
													100
COMPOSITE KEY
/   	\						Invoice
ln #	id 		date 	purchaser 	item 	quantity 	price, 	linepr
(1		105) 	8/21 	dan 		toothb 	2 			2 		4
(2		105) 	8/21 	dan 		pillow  5 			12 		60
(3		105) 	8/21 	dan 		toothpa 1 			6 		6
(4		105) 	8/21 	dan  		candle  3  			10  	30
(1		198) 	8/22 	sally 		candle  5 			10 		50
(2		198) 	8/22 	sally 		robscop 1 			5 		5

//this is first normal
//how second formal?? Reduce redundancy of Dan Dan Dan
	make a second table:
		Invoice
		invoiceID 	purchaser 	date
		105 		dan 		8/21/2018
		198 		sally 		8/22/2018
	change first table: (remove date and purchaser)

				COMPOSITE KEY
		/   	\						Invoice
		ln #	id 		item 	quantity 	price, 	linepr
		(1		105) 	toothb 	2 			2 		4
		(2		105) 	pillow  5 			12 		60
		(3		105) 	toothpa 1 			6 		6
		(4		105) 	candle  3  			10  	30
		(1		198) 	candle  5 			10 		50
		(2		198) 	robscop 1 			5 		5

	//Now THird Normal Form
	Make a third table: for item
		ItemId 		ItemName 		Item Price
		1			toothb 			2
		2			pillow 			12
		3			toothpa 		6
		4			candle 			10
		5			robscop 		5
		Change first table: (add an item ID, delete line price, price, item)
			COMPOSITE KEY
