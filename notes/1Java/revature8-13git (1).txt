1. Clone remote github repository in an empty folder 
> git clone https://github.com/1808-Aug13-Java/batch-source.git

2. Navigate into the batch-source folder, which should appear wherever you cloned the repository.
    	Use the cd command to change directory

3. Create a local repository within the batch-source folder
> git init

4. Store the location of the remote repository in the directory where your local repository is. 
> git remote add origin https://github.com/1808-Aug13-Java/batch-source.git
   	 This will save a remote name of origin associated with the remote url       **means when u push changes to the
								**original remote repo, git will know where that is lol ;)

5. Create a branch in your local repository with your first and last name
> git checkout -b First_Last			**in original remote repo on github, there are branches :O This is how u make one! :DD
					**the branch will be a repository with your edits called Cindy_Peng

6. create a branch in the remote repository (this will be in the repository at GitHub.com) with the same name as your local branch

-- You are ready to push your commits to the remote repository --    
    
To commit your code locally: 
1. First you must add your changes to the staging area git 
> git add -A     
    This will add all of your changes   
> git add file.txt      		**btw, this file.txt must be IN the local repository lol
    This will add file.txt to the staging area    

** to see what changes are present and which have been added to staging at any time, the command `git status` will show you

2. Committing your code after this will commit the changes from everything in the staging area    **make the commit message
> git commit -m "A concise but descriptive description of your commit goes here"

To push your commits to your remote repository			**finally, push your branch to the origin repo
> git push origin First_Last
