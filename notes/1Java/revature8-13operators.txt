i++ vs ++i??
	i++: access i, i = i+1;
	++i: i = i+1;, access i

.equals -> checks for value
	override it to make it meaningful

bitwise and logical operators
	logical: &, |, &&, ||
		& and |: Looks at variables bit by bit.
			eg: false & true -> false. 
				false&&true -> false(but "true" never looked at since false already false)
		&& and ||: must be booleans

Ternary operator
	boolean amICool = true;
	boolean amIStillCool = amICool ? (print Yes!) : (print Noo! :( );
	* you can do multiple statemetns, just do "," and parenthesis --> ____ ? (a=3, c=4) : (a = 0, c = 0);

Flow adn Control
	if/else
	switch
		eg. switch(i){
			case 1: 
				say winner;
				break;    <---- break important
			case 2: 
				say loser;
				break;
		}
	loops, foreach
		foreach loop ex: for(int i: arr){print i} assuming the arr is an int array, then i is an item of arr
	try/catch eg. exception
