Reflection:
	an API used to inspect classes, interface, methods at run time without knowing the names of these at compile time
		get implemented interfaces or super classes, method signatures and properties, and access modifiers
		can change these property values and execute methods 

		good time to use: used mostly in debuggers, frameworks(so other frameworks can interact too)

		cons: If you're getting a method signature but no exist, get NoSuchMethodException, exposes innerworkings of ur program
