Strings
immutable sequence of characters

y strings immutable?
		their value is the location not the value? FIXME ask on slack why again are not immutable?

String pool
	allocation in heap memory where strings are stored
	for more efficient memory management
		Like if we have made many strings with "star", why make a bunch of memories of "star?"
		just place "star" once and all variables v=with value "star" will point to one location

		eg.													String Pool:
			String s1 = "dog"  -----creates in pool---->   1.   "dog"
			String s2 = "cat"  -----creates------------>   2.   "cat"
			String s3 = "dog"  -----> 1.
			String s4 = "cat"  -----> 2.
			String s4 = "cat"  -----creates------------>   3.	"cat!"


			s3 == s5  		=> false
			s3.equals(s5) 	=> true
			
	How do I make new string, but I don't make all of it in memory, just allocate nonpermanently??
			new String("dog"); Just use new. 
			Intern returns a string w a reference in the string pool (sp)

Want a mutable sequence of characters? what to do
		string builder or string buffer. objects that behave like strings, but have mutable sequences
		Use if we will change the string a lot, because if we have to add a lot of different strings,
			wouldnt be efficient, defeating purpose of string pool
		Both have same functions: Append, reverse, insert, 
		String Buffer's methods are synchronized, making it thread safe, while builder not thread safe
			although bcuz synchronized, a bit slower than builder
