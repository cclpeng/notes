	In HTML:
	<h1 *ngIf = 'Condition'>Heading</h1>   
				condition=true  =====> Heading
				condition=false =====> 

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Email</th>
			<th>Hire Date</th>
		</tr>
		<tr *ngFor = "let employee of employees">
			<td>{{employee.name}}</td>
			<td>{{employee.email}}</td>
			<td>{{employee.hireDate}}</td>
		</tr>
	In TS:
		employees = [{
			name: 'sally'
			email: 's@gmail'
			hireDate: /3.5.12
		}, {
		    name: 'joe'
		    email: 'joe@gmail'
		    hireDate: /2/4/5
		}, {
			etc...
		}]

Pipes
	Used to change way data is rendered or displayed
		formating dates
		format currency
		transform text
	use with string interpolation (below r examples built in pipes)
		{{ product.name | uppercase }} Can chain pipes too! add more
		{{ product.price | currency: 'USD' }}
	*[ngModel] is one way databinding?? i thoughtit was 2 x.x

	Custom Pipes:
		Create a class
		implement the transformation method A --> {{ __ | A }}
		@Pipe({
			name: "myPipe"    //must register this tho
		})
			Register with module, include in Declarations
	When to use Custom Pipe? Example
		say names are string-cheese, gala-apples, ground-beef.
		BUT we want string cheese, gala apples, ground beef.
		No existing pipe for that

		in command line:
			ng generate pipe folder/name-of-pipe   //if folder dont exist, makes one
