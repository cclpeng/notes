Front Controller Design Pattern
	Same as usual Servlet cycle, but now we'll have a 
	Master Servlet acting as our "Front Controller"

		"master servlet" or "dispatcher servlet" acts as our front
			controller and can route request accordingly
			Many master servls use a Request Helper 
		our front controller can handle all of the application-wide
			needs such as caching or session management
