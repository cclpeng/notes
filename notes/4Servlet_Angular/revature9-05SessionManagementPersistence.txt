session management, Persistence across diff web pages
we're doing angular tomorrow :( 9-06. can google a bit if helpful

Session Management: (4 ways, sess obj best)
	save username/id. generate a nav bar based on a specific username
	can save the nav bar in the session object and itll load
	only saves a small string tho

	Cookies:
		simple name pairs stored inthe browser
		limited to text
		don't have complete control on the service side
			can be disabled by user
	URL Rewriting:
		saving information as appended to the url
		a lot of maintain
		cant be disabled like cookies
		exposes our data to the user
	Hidden Form Fields:
		including form submission throughout our application to 
			maintain a state using request parameters
		Information isnt as exposed as url rewriting & cant be 
			disabled, but is still difficult to maintain
	Session Object:
		allows us to maintain session on server side, 
			request.getSession()  ---returns---> 
				1. current session if there's currently a session
				Or
				2. create a new session
			request.getSession(true) new session created if none rn
			request.getSession(false) no new session created
