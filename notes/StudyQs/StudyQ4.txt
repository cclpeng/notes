post() vs get()?
	data parameterized in the message body instead vs in the url(get). 

method siggy of doPost and doGet?
	PROTECTED void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)

some HTTPServer class methods?
	doGet, doPut, doPost, doDelete

what is deployment descriptor (D.D.)
	determines proper servlet to send the requests to. Deployment descriptor is an xml file named web.xml. For spring: right click
	 project, javaEE, configure deployment descriptor. Places in 
	 WEB-INF directory(must be in there), and must be called web.xml

Is XML case sensitive?
	yes :O

What is pojo
	plain old java object

what is web container
	it's part of the web server that can interract with our servlet

Go over Java Servlet life cycle
	1. client prepares http request
	2. create two pojos servlet request and servlet response
	3. web containers consult the deployment descriptor for which 
		servlet to send the request
	4. container calls init() <- overwriteable
	5. web container calls service() which processes
		the client request <- overwritable
	6. send request back to client
	7. next calls to the servlet, web container calls service()
	8. timeout orwhen web container shut down, destroy() called

The types of Servlet request and response?
	ServletRequest, ServletResponse
==================================================================
	1. Describe the Front Controller Design Pattern
		Describes servlet cycle organization. Have a Master Servlet, 
		acting as a front controller, that redirects requests to the 
		correct servlet, based on the 
		Deployment Descriptor. Oftentimes for cleaner, more organized
		code, there is a RequestHelper to determine the correct 
		servlet for the Master. Then Master just performs the redirect
	2. Which servlet handles session management?
		Master Servlet. Master Servlet handles all application-wide things like caching and session management
	3. How do we have persistence with our servlets?
		Session Management
	4. What is session management
		saving certain credential strings so that you can customize the web app for a specific user while the user is logged in, or before the session times out for that user.
	5. What are 4 ways of providing session management?
		Cookies, URL Rewriting, Hidden Form Fields, Session Object
	6. Cookies
		they are name pairs stored in the browser. Con is that the user can disable cookies, limiting the service side's control
	7. URL Rewriting
		changes the url to have information. Users can't disable it, which is nicer than cookies, but it exposes our information to users
	8. Hidden Form Field
		con is difficult to maintain. what it does is, it saves form information from request parameters and uses that to maintain
		a certain state. 
	9. Session Object
		We create java object on the service side with the string being saved. Easier to maintain, complete control service side
===================================================================
What is angular?
	Javascript Framework
		Uses Html templates and Typescript
Benefits of Angular?
	Single Page Application, very responsive + fast. modular, strong data binding
How does angular work?
	The application is broken down into components, includng services. Components display html content, and the services provide functionality components in general can use
Differences typescript and JS?
	TS has more type safety than JS. If you do var:type, then that var must have type of "type", can set function return alues
	function(): type {}

Which html file in angular app has the full html elements?
	index.html: <html>
					<head>
					<body>
						<app-root>    <---- <app-root> would have
											<app-component></app-component>
											<app-component2>
											<app-component3>

	1. what is one way data binding? how to do it?
		Where the controller accesses the view and changes it. Changes in . how: use string interpolation
		{{}} or property binding:[class]=dslfk. with prop binding,
		dslfk is read into class. However, dslfk side can not access
		or view class. It's one way only. 
	2. what about 2 way data binding?
		how: set by doing [attribute/property] = "variable"
		Here the controller access the view and changes, but also users can change the view??
		//FIXME

	3. What is a directive
		it's a custom html element. eg. the selectors we have for 
		our components like <app-first> are directives

	4. 3 kinds of directives?
		components, structural (*ngFOr/if), attribute (*ngClass, *ngModel, *ngStyle)
===============================================================
	1. wat do we use import for in angular?
		external modules
	2. where do we register our custom pipes?
		register with module, include in declarations
	3. what is one way and two way databinding?
		//fixme
	4. What is a component? 
		//fixme honestly dont rl know
	4. how to generate new component in angular?
		ng generate component components/name
		ng g c components/name
	5. what is a directive in angular
		//fixme
	6. how to create angular app?
		ng new app_name
		ng serve
	7. what is property binding in html?
