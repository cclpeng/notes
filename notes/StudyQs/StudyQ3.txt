which html elems are self closing?

HTTP
	hyper text transfer protocol

html?
	hyper text markup language. uses tags to describe the website's structure. Building blocks of the website

-------------------------------------------------------JS
java has methods, javascript has functions

Coercion:
	implicit forced type casting

falsy:
	null, "", NaN, false, undefined, 0
Data types?
	Number, Undefined, String, Null, symbol, boolean
What is interpreted vs Compiled language
	interpreted runs line by line
	Benefit is faster to code,
	however, slower to run than compiled languag
Guard operator? 
	&&    . with booleans, is short circuited, but can be used w other vals!
Default operator?
	||      eg A||B. If A,return A.
Block scope?
	let, const.   var
What is const?
	const let
doesnt allow for granular controller/block scope?
	var
What is variable hoisting?
	when a variable is lifted to the top of its scope. If it's undeclared variable (a = 34; without let, var, or const), then
	it will just be hoisted to global

What is semicolon injectig?
	js auto adds semicolons if no { bracket eg.
		return   <==auto adds a semi colon
		{     
		return { <==doesnt add semi colon

What is closure/
	fuction inside a function. returns a variable available in the outer function. allows access of the variable outside of both functions because the inner function is declared with the same
	scope as the variable it 
	function(){
		var a;
		function(){			<=== has access to scope above it
			console.log(a++);  <== so it can access "a"
		}
	}

Dom?
	document object model. Representing HTML elements as javascript objects (or nodes)

Top of dom?
	window ->  document ->html	-> head
								-> body
DOM 
	firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, previousSibling
	 parentNode
What are events?
	interactions with the user that can be kept track of w js
3 ways to set events?
	JS: addEventListener("___", function, useCapture(true/false))
	addEventListener("click", function, true); //default FALSE (bubbling)
	can also do getElementById("").onclick = "function()";
	can aslo do <select onclick="function()">


whats propagation?
	interract w object. and the event triggers for all its parents/child. that would be propagating
What's stopPropagation and stopImmediatePropagation
	
what is capture? bubble?
	capture going down to children, bubble going up parent.

callback function?
	function name passed as a parameter of an argument. eg is in
	addEventListener. THe function passed in is a callback function

json
	java script object NOTATION
	get info from a web api/ database. has the ``

language agnostic data format
	any language can be turned to another??

two json fuctions?
	JSON.parse takes in: JSONstring ==> Javascript obj
	JSON.Stringify takes in: JS object ==> JSON string ...eg. can print obj

Template literal?
	string interpolation -->  ${}

asynchrononous javascript axml... AJAX
	asynch: dont have to wait for a request and returning message
			before sending more requests
protocol describing how to handle communication over a 
    network?
    http

what goes in the head?
	title, metadata, links, 


cascading?
	for css means Inline has precedence over internal, over ex

what is post and get?
	post. when we dont want credentials to be shown. Sending
	get. Retrieving.

what is cdn?
	content delivery network. how we linke our apps to bootstrap

is html a programming language? wat about js?
	no and yes

{}+{} = ?
	NaN
[]+[] = ?
	[]  see others in notes 
[] +{} =
	
{} + [] =

what will everything thats not primitive inherit from?
	object
Properties of an object?
	
Guard/defaultoperators
	work with truty/falsy values too not just boolean

DOM manipulation?
	javascript use to manipulate the document object model. changing
	html elements using javascript, without changeing html
	window, document, html, etc

	dynamically remove/add things from the dom

if capture/bubble are both on?
	capture takes precedence.

EventListener: the optional flag? tell more
	it's called useCapture. default set to false (use bubbling)
	can set to true

JSON?
	pull information from elsewhere. 

template literal
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
	allows for multiline strings + str interpolation(vs extrapolation)
	String Interpolations where you evaluate the string inside the ${}, and replace ${} witht the value of the evaluated string
	a = 5; ${a} takes "a" and evaluates, replacing with "5"

ajax
	asynchronous javascript and xml
		what it is is procedure to access web servers from a web page
Included in HTTP request?
	http method, header request, body request, url, http version
what are http methods? 
	8 of them: get, put, post, delete, trace, patch, options, head 
included in http response?
	status code
xml HTTP request properties
	readyState, onreadyStateChange, statusCode, statusText, responseT
list of Xml HTTP Request readyState properties
	UNSENT, OPENED, HEADERS RECEIVED, LOADING, DONE
ajax workflow?
	make new XML HtTP request object
	request headers
	open
	send

xml?
	extensible markup language

wellformed xml vs valid xml?
	syntactically works,   <= 
	schemas defined elsewhere <= valid. does what is intended


DTD - <!DOCTYPE html> <== google more Documet Type Definition
DTD Document Type Definition
PCD Parsed Character Data. tags treated as markup. elements expande
CD Unparsed character data.
XSD XML Schema Definition
xml schema - sxd. written in xml. can declare simple and complex types 
xml namespace = anyone can create their own tags
	names let us diffferentiate between other users code
	xmlns:"namespace"
parsing xml: 

jaxp
 java api for xml processing
 	theres 2 ways DOM. loads all of the tree model into memory. fast
 	for small files, slow for large files. Better way for large files
 	is using the Simple API for XML parsing. This is read only, and 
 	streams the data without loading into memory. Fast for large files.

 	marshalling: Turning the Java object into XML string.
 	Unmarshalling: Turning the XML String back into the Java object
