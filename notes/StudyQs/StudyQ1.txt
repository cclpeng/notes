Week 1 questions to study

What does super() in java do?
	used to call constructor of parent class
		eg. 
			Parent(int var, String s) <---parent const is 
						....	
			Child(int var, String s, int i) { <---child is
			  	super(var, s); 	<--super() fills inherited var for us
			  	this.i = i;
			}
	can invoke in a method to be overridden to call parent method
		eg.
			Dog class
 				say() { print "I'm a dog"}
			Beagle class extends Dog
				@Override
				say() { 
					super.say();		//"I'm a dog"
					print " ... but more specifically a beagle!!"}
	super() on its own is just good practice to put in a default cons
		so you're reminded that this constructor doesnt set the var

What's the difference between || and |    plus   && and &?
