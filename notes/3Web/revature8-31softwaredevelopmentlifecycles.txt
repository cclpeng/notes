software development lifecycles

Types of cycles, Methodologies
	waterfall
		linear way to create the project. step by step
		if one step has to be refactored, evverrrything has to start 	over
		Stages: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, 
				Maintenance
	agile
		dynamic, flexible, iterative process during which 
			requirements can change, processes can adapt
		daily standups - a time to share progress, goals, and issues
		"user stories" are defined unit of work

		Scrum: implementation of agile methodology
			iteration called Sprints. with sprint reviews
		Kanban: different swim lanes (ppl are going at different 	
			paces). Groups are going different times. SOme have a later or earlier deadline. Less restrictive than scrum,
			but scrum is more organized, at least everyone's on same
			timeline. Can cooperate more if one grp finishes earlier
